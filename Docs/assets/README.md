# Assets Directory

This directory contains screenshots, GIFs, and other visual assets referenced in the main README.

## Current Assets

- `neurondesktop-ui.png` - Screenshot of NeuronDesktop web interface (to be added)
- `search-demo.gif` - GIF showing vector search + filters + rerank in action (to be added)

## Adding New Assets

1. Add image/GIF files to this directory
2. Reference them in the root README using relative paths: `Docs/assets/filename.png`
3. Keep file sizes reasonable (< 2MB for images, < 5MB for GIFs)
4. Use descriptive filenames
