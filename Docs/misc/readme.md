# Misc (Supplemental / Non-canonical)

This folder contains supplemental documents that were moved under `Docs/` to keep repository documentation centralized.

These files are **not the canonical documentation** for how to run the system. Prefer:

- `Docs/start-here.md`
- `Docs/getting-started/`
- `dockers/readme.md`
- Component docs: `NeuronDB/readme.md`, `NeuronAgent/readme.md`, `NeuronMCP/readme.md`, `NeuronDesktop/readme.md`
