# Documentation Improvement Summary (Regenerated)

This file summarizes the intent behind the documentation layout in `Docs/`.

## Goals

- Make onboarding fast (beginner docs)
- Keep deep internals separate (advanced docs)
- Provide stable lookups (reference docs)
- Reduce duplication by linking to source paths and component READMEs

## What changed in this regenerated set

- Consolidated documentation entry point: `DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Established structure contract: `Docs/structure.md`
- Organized getting-started docs for setup + troubleshooting
- Maintained reference docs (glossary + summary)

## Recommended next improvements

- Add concrete, runnable commands for:
  - docker compose quickstart
  - extension install/build
  - smoke tests and example queries
- Add “production hardening” advanced docs:
  - auth, audit, backup/restore, observability
