-- SQL Recipe Library: Hybrid Search
-- ============================================================================
-- Ready-to-run queries for combining vector search with full-text search
-- 
-- Prerequisites:
--   - NeuronDB extension installed
--   - Quickstart data pack loaded (or your own table with embeddings)
--   - Full-text search indexes (GIN indexes on tsvector columns)
--
-- Usage:
--   psql -f 02_hybrid_search.sql
--   Or copy individual queries to run them
--
-- Table: quickstart_documents (from quickstart data pack)
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- Setup: Add full-text search support to quickstart_documents
-- ============================================================================
-- Run this once to enable full-text search on the quickstart table

-- Add tsvector column for full-text search
ALTER TABLE quickstart_documents ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS fts_vector tsvector;

-- Populate full-text search vectors from title and content
UPDATE quickstart_documents
SET fts_vector = to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(title, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(content, ''))
WHERE fts_vector IS NULL;

-- Create GIN index for full-text search (if not exists)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_quickstart_fts 
ON quickstart_documents USING gin(fts_vector);

-- ============================================================================
-- Notes:
-- ============================================================================
-- 
-- 1. Hybrid search combines the strengths of semantic (vector) and keyword 
--    (full-text) search for better results.
--
-- 2. Weighted combination is simpler but RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) often
--    performs better, especially when result sets don't overlap much.
--
-- 3. Tune the weights (e.g., 0.7 vector, 0.3 FTS) based on your use case:
--    - More vector weight: Better for semantic/synonym matching
--    - More FTS weight: Better for exact keyword matching
--
-- 4. In production, use embed_text() to generate query vectors from text:
--    WITH q AS (SELECT embed_text('your query') AS query_vec)
--    ...
--
-- 5. Ensure you have both HNSW index on embeddings and GIN index on tsvector
--    for optimal performance.
