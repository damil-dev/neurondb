-- ============================================================================
-- Recipe: Weighted Hybrid Search
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Fine-tune the balance between vector and text search results
-- 
-- Prerequisites:
--   - quickstart_documents table
--   - Full-text search index (from previous recipe)
--   - Embeddings column populated
--
-- Tuning Tips:
--   - Higher vector weight: Better for semantic understanding
--   - Higher text weight: Better for exact keyword matching
--   - Adjust weights based on your data and use case
--
-- Performance Notes:
--   - Weighting doesn't significantly impact query time
--   - Consider caching weighted scores for frequently used weights
-- ============================================================================

-- Example 1: Configurable weights via CTE
-- Easy to adjust vector_weight and text_weight
