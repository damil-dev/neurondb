## Code Standards

### Code Style Enforcement

All code must conform to the style guidelines enforced by automated tools. Code that doesn't pass style checks will be rejected.

#### C Code (NeuronDB Extension)

- **Style**: 100% PostgreSQL C coding standards
- **Formatting Tool**: `pgindent` (PostgreSQL's official formatter)
- **Check Tool**: `pgident` (identifier style checker)

**Formatting:**
```bash
# Format all C files
cd NeuronDB
./scripts/run_pgindent.sh

# Check formatting without modifying files
./scripts/run_pgindent.sh --check

# Show diff of formatting changes
./scripts/run_pgindent.sh --diff
```

**Style Rules:**
- Use tabs for indentation (PostgreSQL standard)
- Only C-style `/* */` comments (no `//` comments)
- Variables declared at start of function (C89/C99 compliance)
- Prefix all functions with `neurondb_`
- Include copyright and file description in headers
- Maximum line length: 80-90 characters

**CI Enforcement:**
- Formatting is checked automatically in CI
- PRs with formatting violations will fail CI checks

#### Go Code (NeuronAgent, NeuronMCP)

- **Formatting Tool**: `gofmt` (standard Go formatter)
- **Linting Tool**: `golangci-lint` (recommended)

**Formatting:**
```bash
# Format all Go files
go fmt ./...

# Or use gofmt directly
gofmt -w .
```

**Linting:**
```bash
# Install golangci-lint (if not installed)
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest

# Run linter
golangci-lint run ./...
```

**Style Rules:**
- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use `golint` guidelines for naming and structure
- Maximum line length: 120 characters (Go standard)
- Prefer explicit error handling
- Use meaningful variable names

**CI Enforcement:**
- Formatting and linting checked automatically in CI
- PRs with violations will fail CI checks

#### TypeScript/JavaScript Code (NeuronMCP, NeuronDesktop)

- **Formatting Tool**: `prettier` (recommended) or `eslint --fix`
- **Linting Tool**: `eslint`

**Formatting:**
```bash
# Using prettier
npm run format

# Using eslint
npm run lint -- --fix
```

**Linting:**
```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

**Style Rules:**
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (JavaScript/TypeScript standard)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names

**CI Enforcement:**
- Formatting and linting checked automatically in CI
- PRs with violations will fail CI checks

### Summary Table

| Language | Formatting Tool | Linting Tool | Max Line Length | Indentation |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| C | `pgindent` | `pgident` | 80-90 | Tabs |
| Go | `gofmt` | `golangci-lint` | 120 | Tabs |
| TypeScript/JS | `prettier`/`eslint` | `eslint` | 100 | 2 spaces |

### Build Requirements
- **Zero warnings**: Code must compile with `-Wall -Wextra` clean
- **Zero errors**: All compilation must succeed
- **All platforms**: Test on Linux and macOS
- **PostgreSQL versions**: Support PG 15, 16, 17, 18

### Testing
- Add regression tests in `sql/` with expected output in `expected/`
- Add TAP tests in `t/` for integration testing
- Run `make installcheck` before submitting PR
- Document test cases clearly

   - Linting checks
   - Test suite execution
   - Build verification

2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer must approve
   - Code quality and correctness
   - Adherence to coding standards
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation completeness

3. **Review SLA Expectations**:
   - **First review:** Within 48 hours of PR submission
   - **Follow-up reviews:** Within 24 hours of author response
   - **Review focus areas:**
     - Code correctness and edge cases
     - Performance implications
     - Security considerations
     - API contract compliance (for public APIs)
     - Test coverage adequacy

4. **Merge Requirements**:
   - All CI checks must pass
   - At least one approval from code owners

### Test Requirements

**Minimum Test Coverage:**
- **New features:** 80%+ code coverage for new code
- **Bug fixes:** Test case that reproduces and verifies fix
- **API changes:** Integration tests for public APIs

**Test Types Required:**
- **Unit tests:** For individual functions/components

cd NeuronAgent
go test ./...

cd ../NeuronMCP
go test ./...

# Integration tests
./scripts/verify_neurondb_integration.sh
```

### Style Enforcement

**Pre-commit Hooks:**
We recommend setting up pre-commit hooks to catch style issues early:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not installed)
pip install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Automated Enforcement:**
- CI automatically checks formatting and linting
- PRs with style violations will fail CI
- Fix style issues before requesting review

## Code Review

All submissions require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.

## Community

- Be respectful and constructive
- Follow PostgreSQL community guidelines
- Help others when possible
- Contact: support@neurondb.ai for questions

## Commit Message Guidelines

### General Rules

- The subject line must end with a period and should be concise and clear,
  typically not exceeding a single line.

- Write commit messages in paragraph form rather than as bullet points or
  lists, making sure to clearly communicate the content of the change.

- Do not reference specific file names or locations within the commit
  message text.

- Omit any mention of merge or cherry-pick actions, such as "Cherry-picked
  commit..." or "Merge commit...".

- Exclude any references to code cleanup, coding standards, or style
  violations (e.g., "C90 violation", "cleanup", or "coding standard changes").

- Leave out references to version compatibility or APIs, such as
  "PostgreSQL compatibility" or "API changes".

- Avoid including statements about the status of the codebase, such as
  whether it compiles correctly or if all errors have been resolved.

- Focus exclusively on what has changed in the commit. Do not explain
  why it was done, and do not comment on compliance with standards or
  practices.

- The body of the message should be written in clear paragraphs, providing
  a concise narrative that describes the change, breaking details into
  additional paragraphs as necessary for clarity.

- Each line contains max 80-90 characters.

- According to Module add NeuronDB:, NeuronMCP: or NeuronAgent: in first
  line of commit message.

### Example

```
NeuronDB: Improve embedding vector normalization logic.

This commit adjusts the normalization routine to
use a more numerically stable approach, addressing
issues with denormalized input data. Additional
refactoring ensures consistent vector sizing across all
embedding interfaces, providing clearer behavior for
callers and simplifying future maintenance.
