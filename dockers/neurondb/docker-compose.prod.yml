# NeuronDB Docker Compose - Production Configuration
# 
# This file extends the base docker-compose.yml with production-focused settings:
# - Enhanced resource limits and reservations
# - Logging configuration
# - Security enhancements
# - Health checks with extended timeouts
# - Restart policies
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# Or override specific services:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up neurondb
