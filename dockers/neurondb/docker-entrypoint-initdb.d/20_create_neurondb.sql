-- NeuronDB Extension Initialization Script
-- This script automatically creates the NeuronDB extension in the default database
-- when the container is first initialized.
--
-- Note: During initdb, shared_preload_libraries is configured but PostgreSQL
-- hasn't restarted yet, so extension creation may fail. The custom entrypoint
-- (docker-entrypoint-neurondb.sh) will ensure the extension is created after
-- PostgreSQL starts.

-- Try to create the extension if it doesn't exist
-- Handle the case where shared_preload_libraries might not be configured yet
